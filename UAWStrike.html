<div class="container">
<p>For the first time in US history, the United Auto Workers have struck all of the big three American automakers, Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis, at the same time. UAW members are demanding a 40% pay increase, an end to tiered work, and a return of cost-of-living allowances that were scrapped during the 2008 auto bailout. What started as a strike at just three auto plants has escalated to more than 38 states. Keeping track of how many workers are striking at each of the three automakers can be complicated. You can find the tally below.</p>


<h2>The Big Three Automakers:</h2>

        <p>There are 7950 Ford Company workers on strike. As a result of these tactics, Ford has upped its proposed wage increases from 9% to 23%, agreed to Cost of Living Allowances and reduced the required time for a temporary worker to gain full employment from 8 years to 3 years.</p>

        <p>There are 9375 General Motors workers on strike. As a result of these tactics, General Motors has upped its proposed wage increases from 9% to 20%, agreed to Cost of Living Allowances and reduced the required time for a temporary worker to gain full employment from 8 years to 4 years. Additionally, in a historic win for a just transition to electric vehicles, GM agreed to bringing battery factories into the master UAW contract.</p>
